# Domain and state

Status: draft architecture baseline

## Core records

| Record | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Source` | A local, Git, HTTP, or provider catalogue locator |
| `Plugin` | A published package with identity, version, license, and artifacts |
| `Artifact` | A skill, rule, agent, command, hook, MCP server, or resource |
| `Project` | A local codebase managed by Omni |
| `Harness` | A provider adapter such as Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, or Cursor |
| `Binding` | A desired plugin or artifact assignment to a project and harness |
| `Installation` | An observed or owned materialized file state |
| `Operation` | A plan, application, result, and recovery record |

## Three states

Omni must keep these states separate:

```text
catalogue state → desired binding state → materialized/provider state
```

- Catalogue state says what a source exposes at a resolved revision.
- Desired state says what the user wants active for a project and harness.
- Materialized state says what files and provider installations exist now.

No state is inferred from another state without an observation step.

## Invariants

- External source records preserve provider, locator, revision, license, and hashes.
- A personal fork gets a new owned identity and keeps origin provenance.
- An unmanaged or locally changed file is never silently overwritten.
- A target path is resolved by a harness adapter and stays inside an approved root.
- A plugin package and its child artifacts remain separately addressable.
- Provider caches are observed state, not source-of-truth records.
- Executable artifacts require a capability and approval boundary.

## Result model

Every boundary operation returns a typed result with success, warnings, or a recoverable
failure. A partial source or provider failure remains visible. The UI must distinguish
`current`, `missing`, `drifted`, `conflict`, `blocked`, and `unknown`.

## First vertical slice

The first implementation should prove one read-only source snapshot, one static skill
binding, one target projection, one change plan, and one approved apply. It should not
start with recommendations, remote sync, or executable plugin lifecycle management.
